Running notes rule
------------------
- Keep running notes current for every meaningful Probe Basic or QtPyVCP change.
- Update `docs_src/source/running_notes.rst` with release-note-ready entries.
- Each entry should include: date, area, summary, changes, validation, and touched files.
- Keep newest entries at the top.
